# Class: ServiceInfo

Defined in: [IdeaProjects/kit/kit/src/nest/service-info.ts:21](https://github.com/iagurban/kit/blob/6e66fe680955a3080903eeaad4a49a9a0b2845a0/src/nest/service-info.ts#L21)

Represents service information, including its name, optional short name,
and a uniquely generated client name.

This class is designed to be used for dependency injection in applications
that use dependency injection frameworks.

It provides a factory method for generating a provider to inject an instance
of the ServiceInfo class with the specified parameters.

The `clientName` is automatically generated by combining the name of the service
with a random hexadecimal identifier to ensure uniqueness.

The constructor is protected, ensuring that this class cannot be directly instantiated
but is only accessible through the provided factory method.
