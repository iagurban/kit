# Variable: distance00to11

```ts
const distance00to11: number;
```

Defined in: [IdeaProjects/kit/kit/src/core/numbers/geometry.ts:22](https://github.com/iagurban/kit/blob/fa9fa6938de45d521729171297aa5a63ad08fac8/src/core/numbers/geometry.ts#L22)

Represents the distance from coordinate (0, 0) to coordinate (1, 1).

This variable is assigned the result of invoking the `distanceTo00` function
with x and y arguments set to 1, calculating the distance from the origin
to the point (1, 1).

Value is computed based on the specific implementation of `distanceTo00`.
