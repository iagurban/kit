### [WIP]

My collection for every fullstack project — personal TypeScript utilities and data structures.

- Strongly-typed collections (`ExMap`, `ExSet`, etc.)
- Unicode-key manual sorting with balancing, keyset-pagination helpers (for lists, custom ordering in UI)
- Math, aggregation, native collections helpers
- Helpers for functional flow: small utilities for functional-style coding, lazy getters, lightweight validators, and "flow-helpers" to compose logic quickly and write short, expressive code
- No runtime deps, always linted & tested
- Everything here *comes from the wild* — resuing in actual production or recurring experiments

**Docs:**  
See [/wiki](./wiki) — API and usage notes are auto-generated.

**tldr:**  
- Use as a workspace package in a monorepo with a shared root `tsconfig.json`.  
- Import directly from source, not for standalone/npm use.
